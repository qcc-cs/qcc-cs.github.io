### Lec 14

#### Fraction arithmetics

##### Addition

Let $LCD=lcm(B,D)$. Then
$$
\frac{A}{B}+\frac{C}{D}=\frac{A*LCD/B}{LCD}+\frac{C*LCD/D}{LCD}=\frac{A*LCD/B+C*LCD/D}{LCD}
$$

Is this an standard form?

$$
\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}
$$
Therefore normalization is necessary.
#### Remark
lcm function may also return a negative number. Answer could be zero but LCD is not 1. So the normalization is necessary.
