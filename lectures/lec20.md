### Lec 20 loop n times
Is it possible?
I want to apply for loop n-times,
```
for( ...)
  for (...)
    for(...)  
        ....
          f(...)
```
#### Practice. Make a program which print all n-tuple where each coordinate has a number between 0 and N.
```
\\n=2, N=2 (N+1)^2=3^2=9
(0,0)
(1,0)
(2,0)
(1,0)
(1,1)
(1,2)
(2,0)
(2,1)
(2,2)
```
Hint: If you use the recursion, it will be easy.
