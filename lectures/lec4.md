## LEC 4

### [Reference](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_references.htm)
A reference variable is an **alias**, that is, another name for an already existing variable.

#### Differences between c++ pointers and reference

1.  No null reference.
2.  Cannot be changed.
3.  must be initialized when it is create.

To declare a reference  use &    

```
int n=5;
int &r=n; //must be initialized  when it is create.
```
To change a value of n using r,

```
r=1;
```


#### Check1. Let us make a swap function which swap values of a and b using references.

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void swap(int , int ){
	
	
	      
}
int main() {
	int a=2,b=3;
	swap(    ,     );
	cout<<"a="<<a<<",b="<<b;
	return 0;
}
```
<div id="rbutton-2-2-1" data-try="VM8bIxlvz4UgUHkL/cs203-lec3-check2-for-c%2B%2B" data-ans="VM8bmqIrSsIgqYcJ/cs203-lec3-check2-ans-for-c%2B%2B">
</div>

### [Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
**A sorting algorithm** is an algorithm that hat puts elements of a list in a certain **order**.
There are many different sorting algorithms, like  bubble-sort, quick-sort, merge-sort, heap-sort, insertion sort, shell sort...
[Visual sort comparision](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/)

Here we will study [bubble sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort).
#### Bubble sort
Very easy, but very impractical.






It looks good, isnâ€™t it?  But **it does not work**.
Why? 
Variables a,b in swap and variables in main function **are not same**.

#### **call-by-value**
Swap function only **duplicates values of a,b** from main function.
So there is no way to swap values of a,b in main function.

Now it is time to use pointer.
Fix above function with pointers.

Later, we will study swap function again with the **reference**.

Actually, you can make swap function with a temporary variable, but practically less useful.
[swap without temporary variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm)

### How to pass C-array(s) to a function.

#### Check3  Make a function which print values of a given int array and the size n.

```
void array_print(int a[], int n){
  //For loop
}  
```
<div id="rbutton-2-3-1" data-try="VM8omdoggyI0PcEj" data-ans="VM81sYi3AgRAGSb0"></div>

* Remark 1 When you pass an array to a function, you **pass a pointer** pointing to the array.
So it is equivalent to

```
void array_print(int * a,int n){
}
```

* Remark 2: Array and pointer has **out of address** problem. You may use STL or smart pointer.

```
int a[5]={1,2,3,4,5};
cout<<a[100]; //????
```

#### Name of the array.

Name of an array looks like a pointer since it contains the address(`&Name[0]`) of a given array and allows pointer arithmetic.( Consider name of an array as a label or an **alias**.) 

```
\\point arithmetic
\\a[5] is equivalent to *(a+5)
int a[5]=={1,2,3,4,5};
int *p=a;
```

Unfortunately, there are some differences between name of an array and a pointer.

```
int b[5];
a=&b;\\ a is fixed.
cout<<sizeof(a);//
cout<<sizeof(p);
```
<div id="rbutton-2-4-1" data-try="VM8omdoggyI0PcEj" data-ans=""></div>
